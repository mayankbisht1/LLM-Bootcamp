# LLM-Bootcamp
This is the modification of an existing project "Drop box reterival app" 
The project helps students especially those who are in the research feild as of myself
In this projecrt we are going to create a repository where the students download the research paper.
As a researcher myself I  have trouble to read the whole research paper. 
USing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  significantly improves the capabilities of LLMs.
Now instead of paying or taking subscription to paid version of AI.
I could directly ask question and get best answer from my repository.
The answer provided depends on the api I'm using and the quality of research paper present.
