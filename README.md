# LLM-Bootcamp
This is the project 
The project helps students, especially those who are in the research field as myself.
In this project, we will create a repository where the students download the research paper (Unstructured data, most commonly PDF, PPT, and another text document).
As a researcher myself I  have trouble to read the whole research paper. 
Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  significantly improves the capabilities of LLMs.
Now, instead of paying or taking a subscription to the paid version of AI.
I could directly ask questions and get the most appropriate answer from my repository.
The answer provided depends on the API you are using and the quality of the research paper present.
